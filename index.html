    About Transformation
</h1>
<p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Transformation is not about gaining knowledge and new skills or working in a new and better way, 
    although those things will certainly occur in the process of transforming. Transformation is an <strong style="color:#007698">inside-out change</strong>, 
    generated by <strong style="color:#007698">intentionally</strong> evolving new and more complex ways of understanding, meaning-making, and being.
    Organizations, much like humans, develop and evolve, or transform, in this way in <strong style="color:#007698">distinct developmental stages</strong>. 
    The work of transforming is the work of moving away from one stage and moving toward the next.
</p>
<p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Each developmental stage encompasses and builds on all previous stages. Different areas of an organization may be at different stages, 
    but the organization as a whole has a center-of-gravity in primarily one stage. Within any given stage, the initial focus is typically 
    on lateral development, learning more skills and becoming  better where you are.  New words from higher stages creep into everyday language 
    as popular buzz-words, but what it looks and feels like is different.
</p>
<p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Complexity of mind has not yet sufficiently developed to truly comprehend and appreciate what a higher stage means. The possibilities in 
    further vertical growth are dismissed or ridiculed, and may be actively resisted – “why would anyone want to do that, be that”.  
    It doesn’t make sense because the way sense is made has not yet evolved.

    About Agile Transformation
</h1>
<p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">True transformation is a fundamental shift in the core identity of an organization &ndash; who they are, 
    what they value, why they exist, what they do, and how they do it.
</p>
<p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In an Agile Transformation, there are specific mindsets and behaviors that show up differently based on 
    the developmental stage of the organization attempting the transformation. The Agile Values and Mindset as described by the Agile Manifesto begin 
    to light up in the “people-driven” stage of development; until that point, the language may be in use, but understanding and behaviors are not aligned 
    with the intent of Agile Values.  The image below describes what Agile looks like in organizations at each of the developmental stages.  
</p>
<p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    When undertaking an Agile Transformation, it is essential for an organization and its leaders to Be Ready.  This means they need to:

<ul style="font-size:16px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    <li>
        <strong style="font-style:italic;color:#007698">Be Clear</strong> &ndash; about their purpose; why are they doing this
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong style="font-style:italic;color:#007698">Be Aware</strong> &ndash; of their current developmental stage; where are they starting from
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong style="font-style:italic;color:#007698">Be Realistic</strong> &ndash; about their future; what is possible
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong style="font-style:italic;color:#007698">Be Intentional</strong> &ndash; about their choice; are they willing to prioritize time, 
        effort, and money to reach their desired future
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong style="font-style:italic;color:#007698">Be Committed</strong> &ndash; to the hard work of change; are they willing to accept responsibility
